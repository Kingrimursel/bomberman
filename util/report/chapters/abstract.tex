\begin{abstract}
We trained and tested two different models to do reinforcement learning on the videogame classic "Bomberman". The first uses a simple deterministic Q-table while the second consists of a Regression Forest. Both of our models work with hand crafted features, as this turned out to be the superior approach to f.e. PCA.
We found that while the first model is superior to the second one, it is limited in it's capibilities as it makes decisions very deterministically. It does not have much freedom in finding it's way of playing and reading the game.

We also tried different learning algorithms like simple Q-learning, n-step-Q-learning and SARSA-learning, and went with simple Q-learning at the end as it gave the best results.
